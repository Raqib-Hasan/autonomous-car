Autonomous Cars: Computer Vision and Deep Learning

The automotive industry is experiencing a paradigm shift from conventional, human-driven vehicles into self-driving, artificial intelligence-powered vehicles. Self-driving vehicles offer a safe, efficient, and cost effective solution that will dramatically redefine the future of human mobility. Self-driving cars are expected to save over half a million lives and generate enormous economic opportunities in excess of $1 trillion dollars by 2035. The automotive industry is on a billion-dollar quest to deploy the most technologically advanced vehicles on the road.

As the world advances towards a driverless future, the need for experienced engineers and researchers in this emerging new field has never been more crucial.

The purpose of this project is to provide learners with knowledge of key aspects of design and development of self-driving vehicles. The project provides learners with practical experience in various self-driving vehicles concepts such as machine learning and computer vision. Concepts such as lane detection, traffic sign classification, vehicle/object detection, artificial intelligence, and deep learning will be presented. The project is targeted towards any learners wanting to gain a fundamental understanding of self-driving vehicles control. Basic knowledge of python programming is recommended. However, I have eager to descrive any request by email for learners any details of project understanding.

Tools and algorithms are covered in this project:

OpenCV

Deep Learning and Artificial Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks

Template matching

HOG feature extraction

SIFT, SURF, FAST, and ORB

Tensorflow and Keras
